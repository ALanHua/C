This Week,I did two job.
	Firstly，I fixed a bug about the black border of the video.
The cause of this problem is that the ISP's crop parameters are not configured.In addition, I also adjusted the steps of audio playback to avoid some unknown problems.
	Secondly，I learned some basic knowledge of c ++ language.I have mastered some c ++ syntax.For me, the hardest part of C ++ is STL（Standard Template Library).So far I do not know the principle of STL.Of course, if you do not understand object-oriented thinking, you need to learn a lot of things, such as packaging, inheritance and polymorphism.If you are interested in c ++, I will do a subject training about the syntax of c + + .
